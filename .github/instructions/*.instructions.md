---

## Contributor Workflow

* Do not work on issues unless assigned by a maintainer.
* Avoid opening duplicate or unrelated pull requests.
* Reference related issue numbers in pull requests.
* Follow repository contribution guidelines.

## Testing Expectations

When modifying participant detection or meeting logic:

* add/update relevant tests,
* cover edge cases,
* and avoid regressions in existing workflows.
